# Overview

Our analyses focus on caregiver burden as the *outcome* from a variety of predictors, such as demographics, disorder type, cognitive function, and neuropsychogical profiles. 

# Load data and construct data set

The observations we work with require (1) at least summary scores from Zarit's (caregiver) burden interview (ZBI; CITE) and (2) must not classify as normal or missing in final diagnosis (FINDX). Conditional to the ZBI and FINDX, we include participants who qualify as:

* Dementia (community and institution; cgcc==1 | cgcc==3),
* Alzheimer's (adcc==1),
* Parkinson's disease (parkin==1), and
* Stroke (prstroke==1).

Not included for now (because there are so few amongst this set):

* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als==1),
* Epilepsy (epilepsy==1), and
* Multiple sclerosis (ms==1).

Other conditions to consider later (as pseudo-controls): 

* Depression (depressn==1), 
* Learning Disability (learning==1), 
* Psychiatric Illness (psychiat==1), and/or 
* Migraines (migraine==1).


The following lines of code will read in the data and include only the subjects outlined in the above conditions.
```{r load data and cases, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=55)}
  ## data exist one directory above and in a separate folder 
  ### (in part to avoid committing it to Github for now!)
CSHA.1991.full <- read.csv("../IPN2017_Case_Comp/Dataset.csv")

  ## Conditionals to extract specific participants
  ### start with primary outcome of interest: caregiver burden
CSHA.1991.zarit <- CSHA.1991.full[CSHA.1991.full$zarscore < 99,]
dim(CSHA.1991.zarit)

  ### Now get all data for above conditions
  conditions.of.interest <- c( 
      (CSHA.1991.zarit$cgcc==1 | 
      CSHA.1991.zarit$cgcc==3 |
      CSHA.1991.zarit$adcc==1 |
      CSHA.1991.zarit$parkin==1 |
      CSHA.1991.zarit$prstroke==1) &
      (CSHA.1991.zarit$finaldx !=0 & CSHA.1991.zarit$finaldx !=9)
    )
CSHA.1991.zarit_disorders <- CSHA.1991.zarit[conditions.of.interest,]  
dim(CSHA.1991.zarit_disorders)
```

We now have a subset of observations we should make a pseudo-design matrix of the conditionals above. We want to denote which of the aforementioned categories each individual belongs to:

```{r design matrix, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=55)}
  cols.for.design <- c("CASEID","cgcc","adcc","parkin","prstroke","finaldx")
  CSHA.1991.zarit_disorders_design <- CSHA.1991.zarit_disorders[,cols.for.design]
  
  dim(CSHA.1991.zarit_disorders_design)
  head(CSHA.1991.zarit_disorders_design)
  
```

We can recode some of the values in these columns to something more sensible with a design matrix. The code below to perform the recoding is hidden from the output.

For our project we should begin with just the two sets of variables identified as `target.predictors` and `outcomes`. At this point we have some re-coding to do to convert missing and NA codes, and to convert YES/NO responses or scales to a more coherent format.

## Variables with missing == 99
out.missing.xx<-c("zarscore","cesscore")

outcomes.NAs<-outcomes

outcomes.NAs[,out.missing.x]<-apply(outcomes.NAs[,out.missing.x],2,function(x) {x[(x==7 | x==8 | x==9)] <- NA; x})

Recoding notes and things to be mindful of:

* In general, 7 = refused; 8 = do not know; 9 = missing (all coded as NA in final dataset)
* For neuropsych, 66 = visual/hearing impairment
* all beh.disturb vars have additional coding scheme: not relavent = 4; dnk = 5; could not answer = 6; missing = 9
* coding for score3ms is slightly different for 777 and 888 (see codebook); but coded as NAs for now
